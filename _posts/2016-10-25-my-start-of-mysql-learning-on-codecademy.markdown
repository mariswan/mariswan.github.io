Why shall an Energy Engineering girl learn MySQL? It's not a complicated story to tell: I want to change, and taste the world of code to see if anything interesting.
So I'm just going to state what I learned from Codecademy.com, its quite easy to follow.

At the very first beginning, MySQL language is quite like normal talking that when u want to create a table, u just type CREATE TABLE, then follows the table name; when u want to get some information from the table, for example, 'age' from table 'information', u just type SELECT age FROM information, then u will see the thing u want.
Be careful about the block characters, because it is said u will get fired if u type it in lowercase. I don't know, I don't have a job to get fired.
